# ðŸšª Waiting Room System Guide

## How the Waiting Room Works

### For Hosts (Meeting Starters):

1. **Start a Meeting:**
   - Click any meeting type button (One-on-One, Group Call, Webinar)
   - Confirm in the modal that appears
   - You become the host automatically

2. **Share the Meeting Link:**
   - Click the "Share Meeting" button (blue button with Share icon)
   - Copy the link or share it directly
   - The link includes `?join=true` parameter

3. **Receive Notifications:**
   - When someone joins via your link, you get:
     - **Popup notification** in the top-right corner
     - **Sound alert** (if browser allows)
     - **Browser notification** (if permitted)
     - **Red badge** on the waiting room button showing count

4. **Manage Attendees:**
   - Click the **yellow "Waiting Room" button** in the header
   - See all attendees waiting for approval
   - **Approve** (âœ“) or **Reject** (âœ—) each attendee individually
   - Use **"Approve All"** or **"Reject All"** for bulk actions

### For Attendees (Link Joiners):

1. **Join via Link:**
   - Click the shared meeting link
   - You're automatically placed in the waiting room
   - See a waiting screen with approval status

2. **Wait for Approval:**
   - Host will be notified of your request
   - You'll see "Waiting for host approval" message
   - Once approved, you join the actual meeting
