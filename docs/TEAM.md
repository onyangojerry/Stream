# Team Operating Notes

This repository uses a product-first engineering workflow.

## Principles
- implement behavior before polish-only changes
- keep permission boundaries explicit
- persist state in a predictable schema-store-service-ui flow
- keep documentation synchronized with implementation

## Communication
When shipping feature updates, include:
- what changed
- what route/store/schema it touches
- what user role is affected
- what tests or checks were run
