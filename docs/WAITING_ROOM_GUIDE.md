# Waiting Room and Join Request Guide

## Purpose
The waiting/join-request workflow prevents open participation in public calls and captures requester metadata for moderation.

## Public Request Requirements
Requester must submit:
- name
- GitHub profile/name/url
- short interest description

## User Journey
1. User or guest finds public call in community.
2. Selects request action.
3. Submits required fields.
4. Request is persisted in `meeting_join_requests`.
5. Host/moderator can review and decide.

## Important Distinction
- Visibility is public for selected meetings.
- Participation is still controlled and does not occur automatically after visibility.
